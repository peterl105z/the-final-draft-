			<p>Super fluffy and quick to bark. Apollo can often be found sniffing around for things to bark at when protecting his homestead. If hes not protecting the motherland he can often be found tromping through the woods on his way to his favorite swimming spot. An avid napper who perfers the coldest place he can find. </p>
